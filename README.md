End-to-End Project: AI Workforce Salary Predictor

Welcome to the AI Workforce End-to-End Project! This repository contains
a complete pipelineâ€”from data preprocessing and model training to
deployment via Streamlitâ€”for predicting salaries based on user inputs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Project Overview

-   Goal: Build and deploy a machine learning model that predicts salary
    using features like Education, Experience, Location, Job Title, Age,
    and Gender.
-   Technologies Used:
    -   Python (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, pickle)
    -   Streamlit for the interactive web interface
    -   GitHub for version control and project management

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. File Structure (example)

    Endâ€‘toâ€‘Endâ€‘Project/
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                 # Flask or Streamlit app (if intended)
    â”œâ”€â”€ model.sav              # Serialized model + scaler
    â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md              # This file
    â””â”€â”€ (Optional) templates/  # For Flask-based workflows

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Live Demo

Try the live web app here:

ðŸ‘‰ Streamlit App Demo

You can interactively select the input features and obtain live salary
predictions powered by the underlying ML model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Installation & Usage

a) Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/NithyaShriSK/End-to-End-Project.git
    cd End-to-End-Project

b) Set up the Environment

Install necessary packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

c) Run the Streamlit App

    streamlit run app.py

Open the displayed URL (typically http://localhost:8501) in your browser
to use the app.

d) Alternatively, Use the Live Web Version

No setup neededâ€”visit the live Streamlit demo directly and use the app
online.

5. Features

-   Intuitive dropdowns and sliders for user input (e.g., Education,
    Gender).
-   Real-time salary prediction on selected inputs.
-   Clean separation of model logic and UI logic.
-   Models and scalers are serialized using pickle, ensuring consistency
    between training and deployment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. How It Works

1.  Training & Serialization: A model is trained and, together with its
    scaler, saved into model.sav using pickle:

        with open("model.sav", "wb") as f:
            pickle.dump((model, scaler), f)

2.  Loading & Prediction: In the app (Flask or Streamlit), the
    serialized objects are loaded:

        with open("model.sav", "rb") as f:
            model, scaler = pickle.load(f)

3.  Input Handling:

    -   Categorical inputs such as Education, Gender, etc., are selected
        via dropdowns or radio buttons.
    -   These are then mapped to numerical values and scaled via the
        scaler.
    -   The processed feature array is fed to the model for prediction.

4.  Output Display: The predicted salary is shown on the UI in an
    easy-to-read format.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Future Enhancements

-   Input validation (e.g., ensuring no fields are left blank).
-   Enhanced UI styling and better visualization of predictions.
-   Dockerization for container-based deployment.
-   Collecting real user data to improve model accuracy.
